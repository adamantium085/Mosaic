# tone.of.voice.canvas.md

## Purpose

To define, adapt, or reaffirm the brand’s tone of voice based on project type, audience, and archetype. This canvas supports dynamic tone modeling using Mosaic and ensures consistency across all creative outputs.

---

## Context Memo

Draws from:
- `archetype.mapping.canvas.md` (brand identity)
- `data.summarization.canvas.md` (VoC signals)
- `proposal.build.canvas.md` (strategic positioning)
- `brief.write.canvas.md` (applied tone in briefs)

Feeds into:
- `mockups.request.canvas.md`
- `output.prepare.canvas.md`

---

## Method

### 1. Determine Scope of Voice Calibration

- Project context:
  - Net new brand build
  - Repositioning or tone refresh
  - Campaign-level tone tailoring
- Platform specificity: does tone need to flex across formats?

### 2. Reference Brand Personality

- Pull from `archetype.mapping.canvas.md`:
  - Primary + secondary archetype(s)
  - Narrative role (e.g., Challenger, Sage, Rebel)

### 3. Map Tone Dimensions

Use the 5 TESSERA tone dimensions:
- Intelligent & Strategic
- Witty & Understated
- Clear & Direct
- Confident & Authentic
- Creative & Balanced

→ Rate each on a sliding scale (0–5) based on project needs

### 4. Platform or Audience Flex

Define how tone should shift (if at all) across:
- B2B vs B2C
- Social vs Web vs Email
- Internal vs External messaging

### 5. Mosaic Integration (Optional)

- Mosaic can:
  - Generate tone hypotheses based on prior messaging
  - Suggest tone flex based on campaign archetype
  - Validate tone match in copy samples

---

## Expected Outputs

- **Tone Map**
  - Dimensions, examples, and sliders
- **Platform Tone Guide** (Optional)
  - How voice changes by channel
- **Alignment Check**
  - Sample messaging marked as “on-tone” vs “off-tone”

---

## Relevant Frameworks

- Archetype Framework
- Voice of Customer
- Brand Narrative Role

See `reference.frameworks.canvas.md` for framework definitions.

---

## Loop Integration

- **Phase**: Strategy → Creative
- **Trigger**: Use at start of campaign or when calibrating creative voice

---

## Guardrails

- If tone output conflicts with archetype, rerun `archetype.mapping.canvas.md`
- If VoC signal is weak, re-engage `data.summarization.canvas.md`
- Always calibrate Mosaic using approved tone map before output generation

### ⚖️ Scaling Note
This canvas should dynamically adjust based on:

- Project size (startup vs. institutional scale)
- Loop phases included
- Available insight inputs (depth of data)
- Brand maturity or lifecycle stage

Mosaic must clarify scope if unclear, and adapt output depth accordingly.

If Mosaic cannot determine project scale, insight depth, or audience sophistication, it must pause and ask:

> “To tailor the output, I need to understand: is this a lightweight engagement or a comprehensive rollout? Should I proceed with full scope or optimise for speed?”
