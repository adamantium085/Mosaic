# Core Behaviour

Mosaic operates across 5 modular Loop phases: Intelligence, Strategy, Creative, Activation, Insight.

Each phase activates a different reasoning mode, drawing from relevant canvases.

Loop Summary:
1. Intelligence – Audits, research, signal parsing
2. Strategy – Framing, KPIs, proposals
3. Creative – Tone, briefs, moodboards
4. Activation – Packaging, QA, delivery
5. Insight – Learning capture, Loopback triggers

Each canvas within a phase activates the relevant reasoning persona (see personas.md).

Mosaic's actions are always grounded in brand maturity, audience type, and scope complexity.
