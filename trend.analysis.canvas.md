# Trend Analysis Canvas

## **Purpose**

To identify and prioritize relevant industry, cultural, audience, and technological trends. This canvas dynamically adjusts based on brand maturity, project type, and strategic need—enabling Mosaic and teams to spot forward-looking opportunities and shape strategic direction.

---

## **Method**

1. **Clarify Trend Scan Scope**

   * Determine use case:

     * Early-stage brand (category entry, whitespace)
     * Brand evolution (tone/positioning recalibration)
     * Campaign strategy (channel/format trends)
   * Define which trend domains to explore:

     * Industry, Audience, Technology, Cultural, Creative

2. **Gather Input Sources**

   * Use Mosaic or human research to parse:

     * Market reports (WGSN, McKinsey, CB Insights)
     * Search/social listening data
     * Cultural signals and meme cycles
     * Thought leaders and competitor content

3. **Map Trend Dimensions**

   * Classify trends using:

     * **Maturity** (Emerging, Fast-Adoption, Peaking)
     * **Relevance** (Direct, Adjacent, Indirect)
     * **Risk/Opportunity** (Strategic vs. Tactical use)

4. **Contextual Tagging**

   * Layer brand filters:

     * Mission, audience segment, tone, archetype
     * Project goals: awareness vs retention, launch vs pivot
   * Tag trends that align or conflict with the brand's trajectory

5. **Integrate Frameworks (Optional)**

   * For macro analysis:

     * PESTLE or Cultural Branding overlays
   * For audience-level trend activation:

     * Jobs To Be Done, Micro-Moments, Empathy Mapping
   * All available via `reference.frameworks.canvas.md`

---

## **Expected Outputs**

* **Trend Summary**

  * Prioritized list of 5–10 trends with rationale
* **Trend Mapping Grid**

  * Relevance × Maturity or Brand Fit Matrix
* **Strategic Recommendations**

  * Suggested positioning shifts, creative ideas, or channel adjustments

---

## **Loop Integration**

* **Phase**: Intelligence → Strategy
* **Trigger**: Use in pre-brand build phases, campaign planning, or repositioning initiatives

---

## **Notes**

* Outputs can inform both `proposal.build` and `brief.write`
* Pair with `market.scan` and `competitor.audit` for full-context strategy work
* Can be run quarterly or annually for retainer clients

### ⚖️ Scaling Note
This canvas should dynamically adjust based on:

- Project size (startup vs. institutional scale)
- Loop phases included
- Available insight inputs (depth of data)
- Brand maturity or lifecycle stage

Mosaic must clarify scope if unclear, and adapt output depth accordingly.

If Mosaic cannot determine project scale, insight depth, or audience sophistication, it must pause and ask:

> “To tailor the output, I need to understand: is this a lightweight engagement or a comprehensive rollout? Should I proceed with full scope or optimise for speed?”
