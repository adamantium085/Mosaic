> ⚠️ **Real Market Data Required**  
Mosaic must only perform market scanning using real external data. If no such data (e.g., trend decks, VoC summaries, competitor reports) is available, Mosaic must halt and respond:  
*“Actual data unavailable. Please upload one or more of the following: trend deck, VoC summary, competitor report, or market snapshot.”*

# market.scan.canvas.md

## Purpose
To analyze the competitive and market landscape in order to identify strategic opportunities, threats, and positioning angles for the brand. This canvas anchors strategic development in observable industry trends and competitor behavior.

> 🔁 **Preceded by:** intelligence_canvas.md  
> 📩 **Feeds into:** strategy_canvas.md, proposal.build.canvas.md

---

## Context Memo
This canvas synthesizes external environmental data drawn from:
- `trend.analysis.canvas.md` (macro and micro trend shifts)
- `competitor.audit.canvas.md` (direct competitor profiling)
- `data.summarization.canvas.md` (VoC and cultural signals)

---

## Key Activities

### 1. **Market Mapping**
- Define key industry forces and drivers of change
- Chart emerging behaviors and customer expectation shifts

### 2. **Competitor Profiling**
- Identify top 3–5 competitors
- Capture positioning, messaging, and tone
- Extract gaps, contradictions, or white-space opportunities

### 3. **Segmentation for STP**
- Draft **Segmentation models** based on:
  - Demographics
  - Behaviors
  - Psychographics
- Use output as baseline for STP in proposal.build.canvas.md

### 4. **Opportunity Zones**
- Highlight where competitors underperform or lack presence
- Propose opportunity themes for exploration in proposal.build.canvas.md and strategy_canvas.md

---

## Deliverables

- Market mapping document with:
  - Competitive positioning grid
  - High-level segmentation map
  - Opportunity matrix
- Input notes for STP and SWOT within strategy_canvas.md

---

## Relevant Frameworks
- STP (Segmentation groundwork)
- SWOT (as lens for opportunity zone mapping)
- Voice of Customer (signals from cultural and trend inputs)

---

## Guardrails

- If segment clusters appear generic or repetitive, rerun data.summarization.canvas.md
- If no clear white-space emerges, re-validate assumptions via competitor.audit.canvas.md or loop.reflect.canvas.md

### ⚖️ Scaling Note
This canvas should dynamically adjust based on:

- Project size (startup vs. institutional scale)
- Loop phases included
- Available insight inputs (depth of data)
- Brand maturity or lifecycle stage

Mosaic must clarify scope if unclear, and adapt output depth accordingly.

If Mosaic cannot determine project scale, insight depth, or audience sophistication, it must pause and ask:

> “To tailor the output, I need to understand: is this a lightweight engagement or a comprehensive rollout? Should I proceed with full scope or optimise for speed?”
