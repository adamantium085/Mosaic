> ⚠️ **Simulated Tone Warning**  
Mosaic must not treat projected tone maps or archetypes as definitive unless grounded by brand documentation or voice samples.  
If none are provided, Mosaic must state:  
*“This is a simulated archetype based on available inputs. Please calibrate with real tone data for full alignment.”*

# Archetype Mapping & Narrative Personality Canvas

## **Purpose**

To define and align a brand’s narrative personality using archetypes, tone dimensions, and storytelling frameworks. This canvas dynamically adjusts based on project goals, market context, and audience—powering creative consistency and Mosaic alignment.

---

## **Method**

1. **Clarify Narrative Intent**

   * Project objective:

     * Foundational brand build
     * Tone refresh or brand stretch
     * Campaign-specific narrative expression
   * Choose whether mapping is permanent (brand-level) or adaptive (project-level)

2. **Select Archetypes**

   * Choose 1–2 dominant brand archetypes:

     * Sage, Creator, Explorer, Hero, Rebel, Magician, Lover, Caregiver, Everyman, Ruler, Innocent, Jester
   * Optional: Layer secondary or opposing archetypes for brand depth

3. **Tone Alignment Mapping**

   * Translate archetype traits into tone sliders:

     * E.g., Sage → Strategic + Clear
     * Explorer → Curious + Inventive
   * Reference `tone.of.voice.canvas.md` for consistency

4. **Narrative Framework Integration**

   * If applicable, define project narrative arc:

     * Hero’s Journey (for transformational brands)
     * Cultural Branding (for zeitgeist alignment)
     * Laddering Framework (for emotional benefits)
   * Pull from `reference.frameworks.canvas.md`

5. **Messaging Examples**

   * Draft:

     * Tagline or value proposition
     * Social post or web headline
     * Tone-match vs tone-break samples

6. **Mosaic Calibration**

   * Feed final personality profile to Mosaic for:

     * Voice filtering
     * Draft validation
     * Tone matching

---

## **Expected Outputs**

* **Archetype Profile**

  * Primary + secondary personality definition
* **Tone Map Extension**

  * Narrative-to-tone alignment
* **Sample Messaging Kit**

  * Applied examples and tone guidance

---

## **Loop Integration**

* **Phase**: Strategy → Creative
* **Trigger**: Use during creative strategy, brand development, or tone system creation

---

## **Notes**

* Revisit this canvas when a major audience, category, or mission shift occurs
* Ensure narrative structure aligns with desired emotional resonance and business model
* Always cross-reference tone logic and storytelling frameworks for depth

### ⚖️ Scaling Note
This canvas should dynamically adjust based on:

- Project size (startup vs. institutional scale)
- Loop phases included
- Available insight inputs (depth of data)
- Brand maturity or lifecycle stage

Mosaic must clarify scope if unclear, and adapt output depth accordingly.

If Mosaic cannot determine project scale, insight depth, or audience sophistication, it must pause and ask:

> “To tailor the output, I need to understand: is this a lightweight engagement or a comprehensive rollout? Should I proceed with full scope or optimise for speed?”
