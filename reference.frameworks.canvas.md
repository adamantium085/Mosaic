# Reference Frameworks Canvas

Purpose

To provide a structured, searchable index of strategic, narrative, design, activation, and optimisation frameworks used across the TESSERA Brand OS. This canvas supports dynamic routing, training logic in Mosaic, and strategic decision-making in human workflows.

---

Usage Guidelines

This is a reference canvas, not a workflow canvas
Use it to determine which frameworks are relevant based on:

Loop phase
Project type or goal
Brand maturity or audience needs

---

Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) – To understand underlying customer motivation and needs.
Core-Periphery Model – For brand architecture and product portfolio.
Porter’s Five Forces – For competitive analysis and industry attractiveness.
SWOT Analysis – To assess internal strengths/weaknesses and external opportunities/threats.

---

1. Audience + Activation

Frameworks for understanding, segmenting, and activating audiences:

Customer Journey Mapping – To visualize experience phases.
Voice of Customer (VoC) – To gather real customer feedback.
Behavioural Economics – To understand irrational consumer behaviors.
Platform-Native Content Strategy – To ensure content fits specific channels.

Omnichannel Strategy – To create seamless customer experiences across touchpoints.

---

1. Optimisation + Insight

Frameworks to measure performance, learn, and grow:

Attribution Models – To understand channel contribution to conversions.
Post-Mortem Templates – For learning systematically from project outcomes.
Growth Loops – For building self-reinforcing growth systems.
Testing Models – For A/B and multivariate experimentation.
OKRs – For setting ambitious, measurable outcomes that align teams.
Cohort Analysis – For longitudinal behavior analysis.
Pirate Metrics (AARRR) – For a holistic view of growth (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, Revenue).
North Star Metric (NSM) – For a single, unifying point of focus for growth.

---

Loop Integration

Use this canvas across ALL phases
Mosaic uses this to match frameworks to project context
Humans can reference it in:

`brief.write.canvas, proposal.build.canvas, metrics_framework.canvas, mosaic.training.canvas`
Any strategic or narrative module

---

Change Protocol

All additions, removals, or updates to this canvas must be versioned
Changes should be reflected in Mosaic’s routing logic

---

Status: Living Document

This canvas is foundational to both human and machine decision-making.
Update it when new frameworks prove effective—or old ones lose relevance.

### ⚖️ Scaling Note
This canvas should dynamically adjust based on:

- Project size (startup vs. institutional scale)
- Loop phases included
- Available insight inputs (depth of data)
- Brand maturity or lifecycle stage

Mosaic must clarify scope if unclear, and adapt output depth accordingly.

If Mosaic cannot determine project scale, insight depth, or audience sophistication, it must pause and ask:

> “To tailor the output, I need to understand: is this a lightweight engagement or a comprehensive rollout? Should I proceed with full scope or optimise for speed?”
