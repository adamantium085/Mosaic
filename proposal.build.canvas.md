> ⚠️ **Missing Input Check**

If a proposal is requested and relies on perspectives, strategic context, or source data that is not provided, Mosaic must respond:

*“A proposal requires defined inputs—stakeholder data, brand brief, or strategic prompt. Please confirm or upload these before proceeding. Mosaic cannot simulate business logic unless explicitly requested for prototyping.”*

# proposal.build.canvas.md

## Purpose
To formulate a strategic and creative proposal that synthesizes intelligence findings, aligns with business objectives, and positions the brand for success. This canvas formalizes the strategic intent and conceptual direction before the tactical brief is generated.

> 🔁 **Preceded by:** intelligence_canvas.md, strategy_canvas.md  
> 📩 **Feeds into:** brief.write.canvas.md

---

## Context Memo
This canvas builds upon outputs from:
- `brand.audit.canvas.md` (key differentiators, tone risks)
- `market.scan.canvas.md` (competitive context)
- `data.summarization.canvas.md` (trend synthesis, VoC)
- `archetype.mapping.canvas.md` (identity alignment)

---

## Key Activities

### 1. **Strategic Positioning**
- Integrate insights from the STP framework:
  - **Segmentation:** Define audience clusters based on market.scan.canvas.md.
  - **Targeting:** Prioritize segments based on maturity, urgency, and alignment.
  - **Positioning:** Craft a value proposition aligned to archetype.mapping.canvas.md.

### 2. **Creative Hypothesis**
- Define a creative hook or platform derived from tone.of.voice.canvas.md.
- Explore language, narrative tone, and visual metaphors based on archetype.

### 3. **Business Alignment**
- Address commercial constraints from commercial.scope.canvas.md.
- Embed KPIs and metrics from metrics_framework.canvas.md.

### 4. **Input Validation**
- Confirm alignment with outputs of intelligence_canvas.md and strategy_canvas.md.
- Flag any critical misalignments for loop.reflect.canvas.md.

---

## Deliverables

- Drafted proposal deck or memo outlining:
  - Strategic context
  - Key audience insights
  - Primary brand message and creative hypothesis
  - Metrics of success (tied to metrics_framework.canvas.md)
- Internal validation checklist completed

---

## Distinction from brief.write.canvas.md

- `proposal.build.canvas.md` is **strategic**: it articulates the “why” and “what”.
- `brief.write.canvas.md` is **tactical**: it articulates the “how” for creative execution teams.
- This canvas should never include tactical deliverable specs or timeline breakdowns — those belong in the brief.

---

## Relevant Frameworks
- STP (Segmentation, Targeting, Positioning)
- Archetype Framework
- SWOT (contextually from intelligence phase)
- Jobs To Be Done (in audience segmentation logic)

---

## Guardrails
- If strategic direction is unclear, re-trigger brand.audit.canvas.md and data.summarization.canvas.md
- If segmentation or positioning appears unfocused, regenerate STP table from market.scan.canvas.md

### 🧩 Proposal Completeness Gate

Mosaic must confirm the following *before* initiating proposal drafting:

1. **Project Type & Goal** – What’s being built or solved?
2. **Loop Phases Covered** – Intelligence, Strategy, Creative, etc.
3. **Pricing Breakdown** – Estimated or fixed cost per phase
4. **Output Scope** – Tangible deliverables
5. **Payment Model** – Fixed, milestone, or retainer
6. **Exclusions** – Explicit items not included

If any of these are missing, pause and request clarification. Do not proceed with placeholders or inferred assumptions.

Use:
> “Proposal data is incomplete. To proceed, I need confirmation of pricing, deliverables, phases, payment model, and exclusions.”

---

### 🛡️ Challenger Proposal Logic

If Mosaic is requested to build a proposal and receives either:

- A collaborator-supplied proposal
- A summary of goals with vague or broad scope

...it must automatically:
- Compare inputs against expected phase, budget, and deliverable logic
- Detect where scope, cost, or deliverables exceed current needs or provide alternatives for the user to consider
- Recommend a leaner or more appropriate phased approach

Use:
> “The current proposal may include items beyond the client’s current scope or expectations. Based on the brief, here’s a revised version optimised for clarity, alignment, and outcome velocity.”
