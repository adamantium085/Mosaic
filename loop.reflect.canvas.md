# loop.reflect.canvas.md

## Purpose
To evaluate the outcomes of a completed TESSERA Loop and generate insight that improves future cycles. This canvas captures successes, misses, and hidden signals—serving as the reflection point for both strategy and system calibration.

> 🔁 **Preceded by:** insight_canvas.md, activation_canvas.md  
> 📩 **Feeds into:** intelligence_canvas.md, strategy_canvas.md

## Context Memo
This reflection canvas pulls signal from:
- `metrics_framework.canvas.md` (quant results)
- `data.summarization.canvas.md` (qualitative signal synthesis)
- `insight_canvas.md` (final analytics and narrative wrap-up)
- `voice.of.customer.canvas.md` or embedded VoC in data streams

---

## Key Activities

### 1. **Performance Scoring**
- Evaluate KPIs as defined in activation and brief.write canvases
- Rank high- vs. low-performing tactics by impact

### 2. **VoC Feedback Loop**
- Identify organic feedback across social, support, surveys
- Align VoC feedback with activation phase outputs
- Determine mismatch zones between brand promise and user perception

### 3. **Opportunity Mining**
- Highlight unexpected insights that emerged during execution
- Capture moments of friction or confusion across stakeholder touchpoints

### 4. **Loop-to-Loop Transfer**
- Extract 3–5 distilled learnings and feed them into the next cycle:
  - intelligence_canvas.md for signal enrichment
  - proposal.build.canvas.md for scope refinement
  - brand.audit.canvas.md for tone or positioning tweaks

## Deliverables
> ⚠️ **Simulated Output Warning**  
If real stakeholder, user, or investor data is not supplied, Mosaic must preface any reflections with the following:  
*“This is a simulated reflection based on the outputs and project structure provided. For true performance insights, please input real stakeholder, campaign, or investor feedback prior to triggering `/loop.reflect`.”*

- Loop Reflection Memo (PDF or internal doc) including:
  - Top learning insights
  - VoC tension highlights
  - Brand alignment scorecard
  - Loop-to-loop flags

---

## Relevant Frameworks
- Voice of Customer (feedback classification and loop)
- Metrics Framework (performance anchor)
- SWOT (misses and threats as reflection vectors)
- Jobs To Be Done (retrospective lens for unmet needs)

---

## Guardrails

- If loop outputs feel disconnected from learning insights:
  - Re-query data.summarization.canvas.md and insight_canvas.md
- If feedback loops are biased or thin:
  - Trigger supplemental VoC collection through audience re-ping or qualitative survey

### ⚖️ Scaling Note
This canvas should dynamically adjust based on:

- Project size (startup vs. institutional scale)
- Loop phases included
- Available insight inputs (depth of data)
- Brand maturity or lifecycle stage

Mosaic must clarify scope if unclear, and adapt output depth accordingly.

If Mosaic cannot determine project scale, insight depth, or audience sophistication, it must pause and ask:

> “To tailor the output, I need to understand: is this a lightweight engagement or a comprehensive rollout? Should I proceed with full scope or optimise for speed?”
