> ⚠️ **Stakeholder Input Required**

This canvas must not simulate stakeholder views unless explicitly instructed. If references are made to multiple stakeholder inputs but none are provided, Mosaic must halt and respond:

*“Multiple stakeholder perspectives were referenced, but no input data was provided. Please upload transcripts, meeting notes, or summaries before proceeding.”*

> ⚠️ **Clarity Check**  
Before proceeding with summarization, Mosaic must determine whether the input includes structured, multi-source, or conflicting information.  
If input is incomplete or ambiguous, Mosaic must respond:  
*“Input appears unstructured or conflicting. Please clarify or provide stakeholder transcripts, briefs, or notes for accurate summarization.”*

## Purpose
To distill key insights from research data, trend signals, and voice of customer inputs in a format that informs segmentation, messaging strategy, and brand opportunity design.

## Context Memo
This canvas synthesizes:
- Survey and interview data (first-party and third-party)
- Trend signals from trend.analysis.canvas.md
- Cultural inputs from brand.audit.canvas.md and VoC transcripts
- Past campaign data and insight_canvas.md performance loops

---

## Key Activities

### 1. **Audience Signal Extraction**
- Analyze qualitative and quantitative feedback
- Identify emotional motivators and pain points

### 2. **Voice of Customer (VoC) Analysis**
- Extract patterns from feedback loops, reviews, and support tickets
- Surface language patterns and unmet needs
- Cross-reference sentiment signals with brand tone calibration from tone.of.voice.canvas.md

### 3. **Trend Correlation**
- Map VoC signals to cultural and trend shifts from trend.analysis.canvas.md
- Identify lagging vs. leading sentiment indicators

### 4. **Segmentation-Ready Insight**
- Organize findings into actionable clusters:
  - By need state
  - By user behavior
  - By stage of journey
- Output feeds directly into segmentation layer of STP in market.scan.canvas.md

---

## Deliverables

- Summary memo of primary VoC themes
- Segmentation-ready insight clusters for STP modeling
- Tension points and emergent desires flagged for strategy_canvas.md

---

## Relevant Frameworks
- Voice of Customer (primary driver)
- STP (pre-segmentation scaffolding)
- Jobs To Be Done (functional & emotional lens on VoC)
- SWOT (contextual tension validation)

---

## Guardrails

- If no clear user tensions emerge, revisit brand.audit.canvas.md and trend.analysis.canvas.md
- If segmentation feels superficial, trigger loop.reflect.canvas.md for recalibration

### ⚖️ Scaling Note
This canvas should dynamically adjust based on:

- Project size (startup vs. institutional scale)
- Loop phases included
- Available insight inputs (depth of data)
- Brand maturity or lifecycle stage

Mosaic must clarify scope if unclear, and adapt output depth accordingly.

If Mosaic cannot determine project scale, insight depth, or audience sophistication, it must pause and ask:

> “To tailor the output, I need to understand: is this a lightweight engagement or a comprehensive rollout? Should I proceed with full scope or optimise for speed?”
