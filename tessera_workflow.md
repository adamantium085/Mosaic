# TESSERA Modular Workflow Guide

Purpose

To outline the modular, end-to-end brand operations workflow used in the TESSERA ecosystem. This document connects each phase of The Loop with its relevant canvases, decision points, and system logic—enabling teams and Mosaic to move seamlessly from insight to outcome.

---

🔁 The Loop Workflow (5 Phases)

Each phase feeds the next and may loop back dynamically. Canvases are invoked based on project scope, client maturity, and brand needs.

---

1. INTELLIGENCE

“What’s true in the world and for the brand?”

Inputs: Signals, research, conversation logs, market data, past brand outputs
Canvases:

`brand.audit.canvas, competitor.audit.canvas, market.scan.canvas, trend.analysis.canvas, data_summarization.canvas`

Outcome: Clear view of brand's current position, audience behavior, competitive field, and emerging opportunities.

➡️ Trigger: Use when beginning any brand build, reposition, or campaign.

---

1. STRATEGY

“What should we do about it?”

Inputs: Intelligence phase outputs and/or pre-aligned goals
Canvases:

`proposal.build.canvas, metrics_framework.canvas, commercial.scope.canvas, mosaic.training.canvas`

Outcome: Defined objectives, measurable success criteria, and a modular scope of work.

➡️ Trigger: Use to align teams, define action, and transition into creative planning.

---

1. CREATIVE

“How should this look, sound, and feel?”

Inputs: Approved proposal, brand tone, archetype, target audience insights
Canvases:

`brief.write.canvas, tone.of.voice.canvas, archetype.mapping.canvas, mockups.request.canvas`

Outcome: Approved creative direction, tone, and initial visual/copy assets for production.

➡️ Trigger: Use after strategic alignment to develop high-fidelity creative inputs.

---

1. ACTIVATION

“How and where will we deliver this?”

Inputs: Final creative assets and rollout planning needs
Canvases:

`output.prepare.canvas`

Outcome: Packaged, QA’d, and channel-ready assets for launch.

➡️ Trigger: Use once assets are approved and rollout sequence is scheduled.

---

1. INSIGHT

“What did we learn, and how can we improve it?”

Inputs: Campaign data, team feedback, performance metrics
Canvases:

`loop.reflect.canvas`

Outcome: Lessons learned, optimisation opportunities, and re-entry triggers.

➡️ Trigger: Use after each loop cycle to calibrate and improve future output.

---

🧠 Supporting Systems

`reference.frameworks.canvas.md` → Used by all phases to select frameworks based on context
`mosaic.training.canvas` → Used to train and update prompt chains dynamically

---

✅ Usage Protocol

Use this workflow to guide Mosaic logic and human team process
Not all canvases are required every loop—invoke based on:

Project scope
Brand maturity
Timeline constraints
Data availability

---

🧭 Outcome

This workflow replaces chaotic, linear creative pipelines with a modular, recursive, and AI-enhanced system.
