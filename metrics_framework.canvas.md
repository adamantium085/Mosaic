# Metrics Framework Canvas

## **Purpose**

To align project objectives with measurable outcomes, ensuring that success is defined, tracked, and optimized according to context. This canvas dynamically adapts metrics based on project scope, phase, and audience needs.

---

## **Method**

1. **Clarify Objectives First**

   * Identify core goals (e.g., brand awareness, conversion, product validation, community growth)
   * Match goals to the relevant Loop phase and deliverables

2. **Select Metric Categories Dynamically**

   * Refer to `reference.frameworks.canvas.md` for measurement models
   * Choose from:

     * **Financial** – ROI, CAC, LTV, MRR, ARR
     * **Operational** – Speed, iteration cycles, QA scores, Mosaic usage
     * **Audience** – Engagement, reach, SOV, resonance
     * **Activation** – CTR, CPM, open rate, conversion rate
     * **Retention** – Repeat usage, CLTV, churn
     * **Brand Impact** – Recognition, clarity, narrative adoption

3. **Framework Matching by Context**

   * For brand activation: Pirate Metrics or Growth Loops
   * For internal success: OKRs, NSM, Cohort Analysis
   * For product validation: Jobs To Be Done, Micro-Moments, Funnel metrics
   * For long-term impact: Post-Mortem + NSM tracking

4. **Benchmarking**

   * Pull from past projects, competitor audits, or platform benchmarks
   * Use current brand maturity and resource scope to calibrate expected impact

5. **Feedback Loop Integration**

   * Define data collection cadence (weekly, per sprint, per milestone)
   * Structure learning sessions to interpret results and feed into `loop.reflect`

---

## **Expected Outputs**

* **Metrics Plan**

  * Clear mapping of KPIs to objectives and phases
* **Tracking Dashboard Outline**

  * Metric category, frequency, owner, visualization model
* **Optimization Loop Hook**

  * Specific data signals that trigger adjustment to strategy or creative

---

## **Loop Integration**

* **Phase**: Strategy → Insight → Activation
* **Trigger**: Use during proposal creation and again post-activation to evaluate performance

---

## **Notes**

* Do not assume static KPIs—metrics must be context-driven
* For framework selection, reference `reference.frameworks.canvas.md`
* This canvas is compatible with Mosaic for dynamic KPI mapping

### ⚖️ Scaling Note
This canvas should dynamically adjust based on:

- Project size (startup vs. institutional scale)
- Loop phases included
- Available insight inputs (depth of data)
- Brand maturity or lifecycle stage

Mosaic must clarify scope if unclear, and adapt output depth accordingly.

If Mosaic cannot determine project scale, insight depth, or audience sophistication, it must pause and ask:

> “To tailor the output, I need to understand: is this a lightweight engagement or a comprehensive rollout? Should I proceed with full scope or optimise for speed?”
