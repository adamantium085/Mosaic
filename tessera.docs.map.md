## TESSERA System File Map

Includes critical system canvases such as Mosaic's command logic (mosaic.command.codex.canvas.md) and behavioural guardrails (guardrails.md)

# Docs Map

📘 Core System References

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `brand_os.txt` | The overarching operating logic of TESSERA (V9) |

| `tessera_workflow.txt` | Detailed Loop phase-by-phase workflow instructions |
| `mosaic.training.canvas.md` | Prompt routing and dynamic behavior training for Mosaic |

## System Utilities & AI-Oriented Tools

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mosaic.command.codex.canvas.md` | Defines standard command triggers and modifiers for Mosaic. Enables consistent AI prompt parsing and modular execution across all Loop phases. |
| `reference.frameworks.canvas.md` | Contains strategic models and mental frameworks used by Mosaic during reasoning and output generation. |
| `guardrails.md` | Establishes behavioural boundaries and fallback rules for Mosaic. Governs safety, truthfulness, tone, and autonomy scope. |

## TESSERA Canvas System Summary

# Canvas System Sumamry

TESSERA System Summary, covering every canvas, structural upgrade, and dynamic feature added across the Brand OS ecosystem. This is your Command Deck for CustomGPT/Mosaic deployment, creative orchestration, and strategic clarity.

🧠 TESSERA Canvas System Summary
All canvases now support Mosaic integration, dynamic scope logic, and shared framework references.

🔁 The Loop Model (5 Phases)
Phase	Purpose	Canvas Modules
Intelligence	Gather insights, trends, landscape clarity	brand.audit.canvas, competitor.audit.canvas, market.scan.canvas, trend.analysis.canvas, data_summarization.canvas
Strategy	Propose, plan, and align on action	proposal.build.canvas, metrics_framework.canvas, commercial.scope.canvas, mosaic.training.canvas
Creative	Define expression and produce assets	brief.write.canvas, tone.of.voice.canvas, archetype.mapping.canvas, mockups.request.canvas
Activation	Deploy and package final output	output.prepare.canvas
Insight	Reflect, learn, and optimize	loop.reflect.canvas

🧰 Updated & Created Canvases

📚 Foundational Reference Layers
🆕 [reference.frameworks.canvas.md]
A central index of strategic models (e.g., SWOT, Blue Ocean, JTBD, Hero’s Journey, PESTLE) that Mosaic and humans use to select frameworks dynamically.

🧬 System Architecture Features
✅ Mosaic-Ready: Every canvas supports AI-enhanced workflows via mosaic.training.canvas
✅ Context-Adaptive: Each canvas flexes based on brand stage, scope, or objective
✅ Framework-Aware: Canvases reference [reference.frameworks.canvas.md] to avoid fixed-method rigidity
✅ Interlinked: All canvases are cross-referenced to ensure data, tone, and messaging consistency
