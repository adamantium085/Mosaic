# brief.write.canvas.md

## Purpose
To convert a validated proposal into a tactical brief ready for creative execution. This canvas ensures that the strategic intent, voice, and targeting direction are translated into actionable instructions.

> 🔁 **Preceded by:** proposal.build.canvas.md  
> 📩 **Feeds into:** mockups.request.canvas.md, output.prepare.canvas.md

---

## Context Memo
This canvas is based on the formalized proposal output from:
- `proposal.build.canvas.md` (strategic hypothesis)
- `archetype.mapping.canvas.md` (brand identity)
- `tone.of.voice.canvas.md` (linguistic and emotional guidelines)
- `metrics_framework.canvas.md` (success measurement structure)

---

## Key Activities

### 1. **Extract Tactical Requirements**
- Convert proposal narratives into:
  - Campaign or asset goals
  - Key messages
  - Audience targeting logic (based on STP segments from proposal.build.canvas.md)

### 2. **Specify Deliverables**
- Define channels, content types, and production constraints
- Align with data from commercial.scope.canvas.md

### 3. **Voice & Tone Application**
- Specify tone of voice constraints from tone.of.voice.canvas.md
- Note any adaptions for sub-audiences or regional/localized executions

### 4. **Measurement Criteria**
- Include core KPIs from metrics_framework.canvas.md
- Tie deliverables to loop.reflect.canvas.md for later feedback capture

---

## Deliverables

- Full tactical brief including:
  - Objective and messaging outline
  - Target audience details (STP-aligned)
  - Brand personality constraints
  - Deliverables scope
  - Metrics/KPIs tied to loop closure

---

## Distinction from proposal.build.canvas.md

- This canvas is **execution-focused**: the “how”.
- `proposal.build.canvas.md` is about **strategic framing**: the “why” and “what”.
- This brief enables creative teams to build directly from STP insight, voice persona, and creative hook.

---

## Relevant Frameworks
- STP (audience breakdown)
- Archetype Mapping (brand voice consistency)
- Metrics Framework
- Voice of Customer (via insights from data.summarization.canvas.md)

---

## Guardrails

- If the brief lacks clear instructions or feels fragmented:
  - Re-run proposal.build.canvas.md to tighten strategic clarity
  - Reinvoke tone.of.voice.canvas.md if linguistic intent is unclear
- If KPIs or deliverables feel misaligned with objectives:
  - Trigger loop.reflect.canvas.md or insight_canvas.md

### ⚖️ Scaling Note
This canvas should dynamically adjust based on:

- Project size (startup vs. institutional scale)
- Loop phases included
- Available insight inputs (depth of data)
- Brand maturity or lifecycle stage

Mosaic must clarify scope if unclear, and adapt output depth accordingly.

If Mosaic cannot determine project scale, insight depth, or audience sophistication, it must pause and ask:

> “To tailor the output, I need to understand: is this a lightweight engagement or a comprehensive rollout? Should I proceed with full scope or optimise for speed?”
